<p class="mysql">
    I have a strong grasp of MySQL queries, and am very confident in creating software and web applications that
    implement MySQL. I have used MySQL in quite a few projects in the past. MySQL is an integral part of an error
    report system built into many of my programs, allowing users to send logs and comments if the program crashes.
    All of my websites use MySQL, and are managed from the web via phpMyAdmin, and remotely via MySQL Workbench.
    Some of my software also includes support for SQLite, which is a great lightweight, file-based alternative to
    MySQL for small applications.

<p class="wordpress">
    WordPress is consistently my #1 choice when deciding what framework to use when building websites. Most people
    see WordPress as something only used when creating blogs, but I find that it can be used for so much more; from
    blogs, to online marketplaces, to portfolios. In fact, this website runs on WordPress. I find comfort in using
    WordPress for many reasons, but mainly because of the ease-of-use and proven security. I have a lot of
    experience designing websites with WordPress, and I know how to make it do what I need it to do. I hope one day
    to create plugins for WordPress and give back to the amazing community.

<p class="autodesk">
    I love Autodesk products. Autodesk has many amazing tools that have assisted me in many ways. I am skilled in
    Inventor and Maya, and have a bit of experience working with 3ds Max.

    Using Inventor, I have created 3D visual models of most of my projects in woodshop at school, which gave me the
    chance to build and scale them exactly how I wanted them, then create drawings of the parts. This made the whole
    process of building my projects so much easier and faster, as I had the exact dimensions of every part and knew
    exactly how to assemble the projects. My favorite project was a hardwood porch swing I built from scratch.

    I have taken a half year class on Maya, and really enjoyed it. I am very capable of creating 3D models in Maya,
    and I know how to work with many different types of materials, including Phong, Blinn, and Mental Ray. I have
    created everything from small buildings to video game characters using Maya.

<p class="adobe">
    I use Adobe products constantly when designing websites and software. My two favorite tools are Photoshop and
    Illustrator, and I feel very confident and skilled while using them. I have experience using InDesign, Flash,
    Dreamweaver, Acrobat, and Bridge as well. I have studied the elements and principles of design, and I try to
    always create pleasing graphics, fine tuning them to perfection.
    I find Illustrator very useful in many different situations, not just in web design. For example, I have used
    Illustrator to design parts to be cut out of sheet metal and aluminum, which were used when building a truck at
    school. Illustrator is my go-to choice when designing logos, because I want to always retain the quality of the
    logo at any scale.
    I think Adobe products are invaluable and you can never go wrong with learning how to use them.
