    Java is, by far, my favorite programming language. I am completely self taught in Java SE and EE. I have created
    multiple programs using both the Swing and JavaFX frameworks, and have used Java to create large scale web
    applications using JBoss Wildfly. I love creating open source software to benefit the community, because I believe
    large things can be achieved from small contributions. I am knowledgeable of many advanced Java concepts and
    frameworks, including Inheritance, EJBs, Servlets, JSF, and JPA. In my efforts to solve real-world problems with
    Java, I have teamed up to create a fully functional asset reservation system to replace outdated carbon copies in
    schools and businesses. I am selling the system through my company, AptiTekk, LLC.
