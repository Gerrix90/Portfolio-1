                My name is Mitch. I specialize in <span class="font-weight-bold">site reliability</span> & <span class="font-weight-bold">software engineering</span>.
                <br/>

                I have a passion for Hawaiian, and I am always looking for ways to help revive this beautiful and forgotten language.
                In my free time I love to weld, fix cars, build electronics, and help others.
